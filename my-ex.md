# Exercise 2 - Notebook Title
This is the title of my notebook.

## Exercise 3 - Introduction
Welcome to my notebook! In this notebook, we will explore various concepts related to data science and programming.

## Exercise 4 - Data Science Languages
Here are some popular programming languages used in data science:
- Python
- R
- Julia

## Exercise 5 - Data Science Libraries
Some common libraries for data science include:
- NumPy
- pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Exercise 6 - Data Science Tools
Here's a table listing different data science tools:

| Tool          | Purpose                  |
|---------------|--------------------------|
| Jupyter       | Interactive notebooks   |
| VS Code       | Integrated development  |
|               | environment              |
| RStudio       | IDE for R programming    |
| Tableau       | Data visualization       |

## Exercise 7 - Arithmetic Expression Examples
Arithmetic expressions are fundamental in programming. Here are some examples:

- Addition: 5 + 3
- Subtraction: 10 - 4
- Multiplication: 6 * 7
- Division: 15 / 3
- Exponentiation: 2 ** 4

## Exercise 8 - Multiply and Add Numbers (Code Cell)
```python
# Multiplication and addition example
multiply_result = 5 * 8
addition_result = 10 + 15
print("Multiplication result:", multiply_result)
print("Addition result:", addition_result)


### Exercise 9 - Convert Minutes to Hours (Code Cell)
```markdown
## Exercise 9 - Convert Minutes to Hours (Code Cell)
```python
# Convert minutes to hours
minutes = 150
hours = minutes / 60
print(f"{minutes} minutes is equal to {hours:.2f} hours")
